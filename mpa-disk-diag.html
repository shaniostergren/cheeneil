                            <p> From Wikipedia ( gt However, as of June 2013, one can no longer use a boot disc to test a modern WD drive independently of an OS. In the explanatory note on its support site, Western Digital omits to elaborate on why it forces users to use Windows to test its drives, alluding to a Mac OSX issue. "Due to limitations in Mac OSX, you will need to connect your drive to a PC running Windows in order to run our diagnostics."

I recently converted to Mac, got a 128gb SSD since I don't store any music or movies on my personal devices. I am using iPhoto and iMovie to store my pictures and iPhone videos. Other than that, I don't really have many apps, no music at all, and no movies (meaning no TV shows or full length movies, I do have ones I've shot on my iPhone/DSLR). My iPhoto library is ~30gb, iMovie library is ~16gb. Yet, I only have 16gb available on my SSD. Some of the apps I could find on the App Store helped. I have Skyrim running fine in Proton but Skyrim Together is a separate program that has to be ran before the game starts. I couldn't figure out how to change the prefix for a steam proton non steam game so instead I'm using lutris to launch the launcher and giving it the same prefix that the steam proton Skyrim uses. I had to go edit the registry in the lutris version of the launcher to help the launcher find the game's executable because when Steam installed the game it didn't change the regist. Hi all! First time posting here. I can't find anything on Google to help out, so I figured I'd give the experts a try. I am trying to restore my 100GB iPhoto library from Time Machine but my computer says there is not enough space. If I hit "get info" in Finder on my Macintosh HD, it says I have 172 GB available, which should be enough space to transfer my iPhoto backup at 100GB, but when I try to it says there isn't enough space. So, I downloaded DaisyDisk to see where my space was being. The app that I use to clean up unneeded files on my Mac (Disk Diag) is saying that there's almost 6 GB of freeable space, but it refuses to actually free the space. Here's a screenshot ( the "freeable files) aren't even being categorized in the app. Is there any way to find these files and delete. Hi I have an old dell eql san raid 50 blue sata 2 I have terminal access and the web console access. and images of all the drives. raidtool thinks 3 drives have failed but the clones are in place. I think there is a way to force a config and try it without it writing to the array. I am looking for some consulting help to solve this - anybody have any ideas - thanks you can skype me at wayne\_horner amp#x200B; thanks amp#x200B. 
Thanks in advance to anyone taking time out of their day to read this. I am pulling two different error codes trying to get Win10 Pro activated from an OEM ISO ( "WIN PRO 10 64BIT ENGLISH 1PK DSP OEI DVD VERSION 1703" Build Date: 5/11/17) installation. gtWe can't activate Windows on this device becasue you don't have a valid digital licence or product key. If you think you do have a valid licence or key, slect Troubleshoot below. Error code: 0xC004C003 and lower on the activation First off, not a sysadmin, but I tried posting this in homeserver and got crickets. Lots of respect for the challenging, often thankless, job you all do. On to the issue. I recently acquired a Dell server (r510 8 bay with h700) I built a 4 disk (3tb x4)raid 6 array, took 1.5 days. I copied over 4 tb of data from my old raid 5 array (which failed a disk during copy). After the copy I wanted to add an additional disk to the Raid 6 array. I popped in the disk and started the reconstructio. Ok so my computer wasn't running the best and stupid me decided to factory restore it, after I tried it came up with this blue screen saying Recovery Your pc/device need to be repaired The operating system couldn't be loaded because the kernel is missing or contains errors File: \WINDOWS\system32\ntoskrnL.exe Error code: 0xc0000221 You'll need to use recovery tools. If you don't have any installation media (like a disc or USB device), contact your pc administration or pc/device manufacturer. 
I have a compaq 7730mt that doesnt like booting to bios, ever since I put a battery in it it (sort of) turns on and the A, down arrow and 1 symbols above the keyboard light up green, its weird. I don't have a HDD in this machine yet, so I'm not sure if thats the issue, but what do you think it could be? The battery I think is good because it does let me charge it, but before i tried using the battery it would go into bios. I'm currently seeing if charging it longer will help. I really really need your help. I have an HP pc with windows 10 and today I downloaded some updates which included something for windows 10, amd graphic drivers and something else for protection but after the pc rebooted it freezed on the window of HP PCs which is the HP logo with a rotating thing under it. This problem happened to me already and I just went on safe mode with f11 and do a restore to a previous point but this time it's not working. First, I got an error saying My PC is having some major issues, and I'll be honest, I'm at my wits end with it. About a month ago, my PC suddenly began hanging at startup. It went from working perfectly fine one day, to being completely unable to boot the next, with no major software, hardware, or other changes I can think of. When I start up the PC, it goes through the BIOS just fine, and Windows loads up until the login screen. Here there is a 90% chance that it hangs and will not let me click through to the user/passwo. I have an HP notebook that isn't loading Windows. It runs startup repair, doesn't work. I've gone through to do memory diagnostic and even tried system restore to 3-4 restore points with no success. StartupRepairOffline 6.1.7600.16385 6.1.7600.16385 unknown 21199907 AutoFailover 13 CorruptFile 6.1.7600.2.0.0.256.1 1033 Is there something I can toss in command prompt? Do I need to get into BIOS? Any help is appreciated! EDIT : Ended up reformatting/reinstalling Windows. Thanks. Hello admins, I'm working on an administritive boot cd that compiles all the useful tools we need on a casual basis. Any suggestions as to what I should It says "NTLDR is missing. Press any key to restart" to be exact. It's a Dell Inspiron 1420, thanks ahead of time. Edit: Thanks to everyone for the answers, my sister in law will take the advice of not running the comp until a technician can have a look, hopefully that saves My 2009 Mac Book Pro performs well gaming, but only sometimes. (For all future reference, these FPS counts are from Minecraft, but I notice the same performance issues in other games, albeit with different numbers) I also always have the same application open when I game (Skype, Steam, and my servers). The problem is that some days my Mac will perform beautifully, giving me consistently 40-50 fps. I'll get on the next day, with the same processes running, and get 9 fps. I have no idea what's. It doesn't look all that interesting. Unknown Intel processor, Red Hat Virgl CPU. The only thing that truly shows it's a Chromebook is that Sommelier is the window manager. Hardware information below. I'm curious about the fact that it shows a higher display resolution than my Pixel Slate actually has. It might have something to do with the fact that I have my display on 80% ("looks like 1667x1111"). Computer Information: Manufacturer: Unknown Model: Unknown. So while trying to run Kernel 4.19.39 and 5.0.13 they freeze seconds after logging in. Currently running 4.15 which runs just fine and stable. I am trying to upgrade everything since I'm having issues with Overwatch running on Lutris, it not a real fps drop but more like a lot of mini freezes. I have done the following: ```GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="splash idle=nomwait"``` the "typical" power supply option Updated BIOS (from AGESA 1.0.0.4 to 1.0.0.6) Updated OS (Ubuntu 18.04). 
Okay so. I used to be able to run ark fairly well with no issues. Here recently, it's been major lag all over the place. Losing connection, lagging in the most awful moments. I have launch options on, I'm using fps fixes and from what I have heard, my computer should be able to run medium at least. Any help would be appreciated. I'm about to pull my hair out. My internet is like 400Mbps. So I dont think that is the issue. I've reinstalled ark, mods, now trying maps. ---- Computer. Hi, I'm an absolute noob when it comes to installing Linux and I've tried for over half an hour to install but it keeps failing. The log also keeps saying the same thing and I don't understand why it's failling. amp#x200B; amp#x200B; amp#x200B; INFO: INFO: 0 to upgrade, 0 to newly install, 0 to remove and 0 not to upgrade. INFO: creating recovery partition WARN: recovery at /tmp/distinst.2kepvM6sNXLb/recovery was not found, therefore no recovery partition will be created INFO:. A few months ago, I installed Ubuntu on my laptop, and I decided to keep Windows and dual boot. After I installed it, I fell in love with Ubuntu and only dual booted to Windows twice  I love Linux. So, should I remove Windows? ampnbsp; BTW, this is what my /dev/sda looks like: (This is mostly the output of `fdisk`, and I added some from `parted` and `gparted` myself.)
